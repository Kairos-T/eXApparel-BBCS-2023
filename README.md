## About our Project:
We are concerned by the immense amount of textile waste -- 254000 tonnes recorded in 2022 -- and we want to make a change. The rise of fast fashion has caused Singaporean consumers to buy clothes on impulse, and older clothes are discarded to make space. Such actions are unsustainable, thus, our product is designed to tackle this by giving old clothes a new life.

Our solution? A clothes sorting program. The program allows clothes to be recycled on a larger, more efficient scale that reduces the involvement of human workers in sorting clothes by replacing them with AI!

With that, let us share our product idea, eXApparel (exchange apparel).
